# DeepLabv3 Implementation in PyTorch
Implementation of DeepLabv3 semantic segmentation model in PyTorch for ECE-8550 final project. A lot of code is referenced and used from [PyTorch's offical github page](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/segmentation/deeplabv3.py) and an [independent approach from chenxi116](https://github.com/chenxi116/DeepLabv3.pytorch). While my version is very similar to other approaches, I have commented a majority of lines for my own understanding and for others who may be confused. Some comments could be inaccurate as I may have misunderstood some of the code but I believe a majority, if not all, are correct.
